Background
Data becomes more powerful when you share it with others! That’s because people can use your data only if they can access it. So, you’ll use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

Before starting
Create a new repository for this project called Web-Design-Challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside my local Git repository, add the following:

Three folders named assets, Resources and visualizations.

NOTE
Add CSS and image files to the assets folder. Add the CSV file containing the data for your website to the Resources folder. Add the HTML pages that display your visualizations to the visualizations folder.

An index.html file in the main folder.

NOTE
Edit the file to be the landing page that a user first encounters when reviewing my submission.

Inside the assets folder, two more folders named css and images.

NOTE
Use these folders to store CSS assets and image assets, respectively.*

Push the changes from Steps 1–3 to GitHub.

Deploy your index.html file to GitHub Pages.

NOTE
By deploying this empty HTML file to GitHub Pages now, you’ll find that it automatically refreshes as you build your pages. You can then review the updates with each push that you make to GitHub.
